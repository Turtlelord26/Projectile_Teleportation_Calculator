# Projectile_Teleportation_Calculator

In a tabletop game I participate in, we have access to movable bubbles of space that can swap-teleport their contents to 
each other. The calculation performed by the webapp determines the resultant velocity of a projectile so teleported, 
taking into account the speeds of both bubbles and the projectile in addition to the angles between those speeds in three 
dimensions, and assuming conservation of momentum. See the attached Word document for more detailed assumption tracking and
the derivation of the equations used.
